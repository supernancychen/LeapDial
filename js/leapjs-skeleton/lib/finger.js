* @class Finger
* @memberof Leap
* @classdesc
* The Finger class reports the physical characteristics of a finger.
*
* Both fingers and tools are classified as Pointable objects. Use the
* Pointable.tool property to determine whether a Pointable object represents a
* tool or finger. The Leap classifies a detected entity as a tool when it is
* thinner, straighter, and longer than a typical finger.
*
* Note that Finger objects can be invalid, which means that they do not
* contain valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical entity.
* Invalid Finger objects can be the result of asking for a Finger object
* using an ID from an earlier frame when no Finger objects with that ID
* exist in the current frame. A Finger object created from the Finger
* constructor is also invalid. Test for validity with the Pointable.valid
* property.
